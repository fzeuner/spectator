Spectator TODO

Spectator get arguments to setup opening folder --> DONE

Update Spectator class to QGroupBox to show the titles --> DONE
	Intensity
	Q - Linear polarisation
	U - Linear polarisation
	V - Circular polarisation

Fix verticalLine behaviour --> DONE

Fix zoom and scaling behaviour
	VerticalLine is not plotted correctly when scaling --> DONE
	OnScaleChange align all the plots

create widget with three labels to be put on the bottom of the app --> DONE
	X: (from the movable line X) --> DONE
	Y: from the static line Y --> DONE
	Value: data[x][y] from the plot array of the 4 Spectator plots (I, Q, U, V) --> DONE

Create packaging with pyinstaller --> DONE 


When changing histogram range,  --> DONE
	adapt right plot yMin and yMax accordingly

Average Functionality --> DONE
	Define key combination (maybe like a single key to trigger the functionality and rever back) to create LinearRegionItem (horizontally = )
		Adapt right plot with mean() of the Y (not movable) range form the LinearRegion

Axes switching (perpendicularly)  --> Not completed, axes switches correctly but the right plot do not picture all the information correctly
	Define key combination (maybe like a single key to trigger the functionality and rever back) to swith the axes of right plot perpendicularly + change the behaviour of the lines perpependicurly
		mean() (of average functionality) will be calculated on the x range of the LinearRegion (therefore draw vertically || )
